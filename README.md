# Asia Pacific Airport Simulation

Simulate the operations of Asia Pacific Airport with concurrent activities such as passengers disembarking/embarking, aircraft refilling supplies, and refueling. Implement a scenario with runway and gate constraints, emergency landings, and statistical analysis at the end.

## Basic Requirements

- 1 runway for all planes.
- Maximum of 3 airplanes on the ground (runway + 2 gates).
- Sequential aircraft operations: landing, coasting to gate, disembarking, refilling, embarking, undocking, coasting to runway, and take-off.
- Concurrent activities: passengers handling, supplies refilling, and cleaning.
- Exclusive activity: refueling with 1 refueling truck.
- Simulate congested scenarios and emergency landings.

## Statistics

- Check all gates are empty.
- Compute statistics:
  - Maximum/Average/Minimum waiting time for a plane.
  - Number of planes served/Passengers boarded.

## Implementation Details

- 6 planes arrive randomly every 0, 1, or 2 seconds.
- Each plane can hold up to 50 passengers.
- Assume no capacity issues in passenger terminals.

## How to Run

- Clone the repository.
- Compile and run the Java program.

## Example Usage

- Provide a brief example of running the simulation.

## Future Enhancements

- Mention any potential improvements or features for future versions.
